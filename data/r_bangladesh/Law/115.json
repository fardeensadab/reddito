The correct date of birth is mentioned on my passport, birth certificate, nid.\nWanted to fix it legally through website but heard it would take me 5-6 Months to get it fixed and there's no gurrantee in it being fixed. As I'm willing to move to Europe for bachelor's. deadline for unis are at end of January-february. Is there any other way i can fix it fast?",
