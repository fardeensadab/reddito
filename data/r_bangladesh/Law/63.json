  "description": "I am working on a legal database software and I need the digital copies of every case judgment that has been made in all courts till now. Some existing websites with great databases are manupatra and bdlex but I’d have to individually download each case , which would be extremely time consuming. It’d be of immense help If someone can help me figure out how I can quickly gather the plethora of data that’s out there.",

It is a significant undertaking with a wide scope.\nYou also need to realise not every judgement is available online or in digital format. May be only high courts / Supreme Court judgements after 2000 will he available.\nWhat about old judgments? Judgments from district / sub district level courts / magistrates?",
