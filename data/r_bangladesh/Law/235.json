      "text": "PUBG Mobile along with Free Fire was banned in Bangladesh last year on August of 2021. Government said it was banned. But in actuality, Govt. doesn't have the technology to ban, nor they removed it from the Play Store lol. The parents of Bangladesh were dancing when they heard Free Fire, PUBG Mobile banned but boi, your kid is still playing the game in his room.\nhttps://www.dw.com/bn/পাবজি-ফ্রি-ফায়ার-বন্ধের-ক্ষমতা-নেই/a-59123996",
