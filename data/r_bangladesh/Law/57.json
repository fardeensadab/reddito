  "description": "I don’t really see myself getting married, and even if I do, I’ve never wanted biological kids. But I do know I want to be a parent. I was hoping someone here might be able to point me in the right direction, especially if you’ve been through the process yourself.\nPersonally, I don’t know anyone who’s adopted or grown up in an adoptive family, so I don’t have anyone close to ask. That’s why I’m posting here.",
