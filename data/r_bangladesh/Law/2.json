      "text": "Almost happened to my mother. Some guys tried to blackmail her as a ‘cheater’ and threatened to initiate mob violence with the intention of essentially robbing her, because she was out with a male friend who everyone in our family knows of; apparently Bangladesh 2.0 means having opposite gender friends is equal to cheating. Eventually, their other friends found her and that resolved the situation. And this is a woman who’s dined and socialized with Bangladeshi and foreign ministers and generals both before and after the July Revolution, and had only just returned to Bangladesh some months ago. This also happened in the same Sher-e-Bangla area.\nEdit:\nFixed missing period",
