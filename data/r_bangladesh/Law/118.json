  "description": "I live abroad but did my llb from Bangladesh. However, I recently decided to sit for Bangladesh Bar Council exam but I don’t have access to any books here. So I was hoping if anyone who could link me to some good sources (online) where I can start preparing for my exam. Also I was looking for “Ain Path” book but since the physical copy is not available here, I would be really grateful if someone provide me any link to download or I am happy to buy as well.",
