  "description": "So recently I got to know a thing from one of close people that they know a person who used to be a police informant had licensed gun. Is it legal to give your informant a gun? He said that \"kajer shomoy paise\" like the informant got the gun when he was working with the police. I did some research in chatgpt and I got to know that there is not even any law about keeping an informant officially. Police hire them unofficially ((correct me if I'm wrong)) The Police can't give a licensed gun to him directly rather they can help him to get the license if he is very important or if he is in a very important mission But the thing is I don't think that guy did any risky or very important thing or something like that And the guy lives in village And that ফর্মা has6-7 numbers\nSo, it's not clicking.. it's kinda suspicious to me And he doesn't work with them anymore\nSo can you guy please tell me more Is it possible to give a simple ফর্মা a licensed gun???",
