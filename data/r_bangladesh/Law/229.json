  "description": "Hello,\nMy Bangladeshi passport expires Jan 2023. I am a U.S. Resident who is Bangladeshi by nationality.\nWill I be denied entry to Bangladesh and have any issues returning back to the U.S. if I try to go to Bangladesh before the expiration date?\nI am asking this because of the 6-month passport validity rule as mentioned in the below site--for example if a person travels to Bangladesh from USA. Is this only relevant to those who do NOT have a Bangladeshi passport?\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bangladesh.html#:~:text=Passports%20must%20be%20valid%20for,obtaining%20a%20visa%20before%20traveling\nThank you in advance.\nEdit: US Bangladesh embassy responded:\nThis is for foreigners travelling to Bangladesh. With your Bangladeshi passport, you can go back to Bangladesh till the last day of the passport's validity because Bangladesh is your home country. Even if your passport expires, you can take a travel permit from the Embassy to return to Bangladesh within 3 months.\nSix months' validity rule is for travelling to foreign countries because there is a risk of the traveller becoming illegal after the expiration of the passport. In your home country, your stay is never illegal even if you do not have a passport.",
