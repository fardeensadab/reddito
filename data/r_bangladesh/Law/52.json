  "description": "Hi I just wanted to know, how hard and lengthy is divorce in Bangladesh for arranged marriages or marriages that happened under family pressure? Also, if a man doesn't love his wife and is not comfortable staying with her, can he choose to stay away from her? Finally, if a couple quarrels everyday. Then can it be a ground for divorce? I am just asking out of curiosity. Thanks in advance.",
