  "description": "I am planning to get my passport and before everytime for police verification they take 500-2000tk for just to approve the already valid verification.\nThis time after the fall of the fascist regime, I am planning to not take part on this bribery and step up to my rights and not give a single penny to them.\nI am not very aware about the law but I am hoping for any kind of defence/security measures that I can take in-case they reject the verification just for the bribe.\nI need some help, Thank you! 🙏",
