          "text": "Yeah this segment was amazing. I admit I wasn't aware of them before, but I've def. subscribed. It's kind of depressing to think that there are folks who are so programmed against Tasneem Khalil and David Bergman that they'll dismiss any exposé or news program that features them.\nThis revelation is so haunting. It speaks to the whole \"banality of evil\" thing, but more like how evil can be right next to you and you don't even know it. I mean people get married at the Dhaka cantonment, and this torture dudgeon is apparently also adjacent to a main road where hundreds of thousands if not millions of people travel everyday. It reminds me of the Argentine military junta's main underground torture dudgeon which was near their national football stadium. Prisoners could actually hear the cheers of the crowd during Argentina's final match vs the Netherlands in 1978...beyond haunting.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBMeTDu03fc",
