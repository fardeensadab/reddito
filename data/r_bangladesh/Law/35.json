  "description": "I was born in Bangladesh but live in the UK and hold a British passport (my Bangladeshi passport is expired). I’ll be travelling to Bangladesh soon. From what I understand, people of Bangladeshi origin normally need a “No Visa Required” (NVR) stamp on their foreign passport, but I don’t have enough time to get that before I travel.\nAm I still able to get a visa on arrival (VOA) with my British passport?\nIt'll be very obvious from looking at my birth origin and name I'm Bangladeshi lol",
