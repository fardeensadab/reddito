  "title": "A legal question about cinema halls.",
  "description": "I can certainly call four of my friends to my house to watch a movie,right? My question is when does it become a legal problem for me to show a movie to other people? Is it the number of people? Size of the screen? Whether I'm getting paid? When does it become \"cinema hall\" from just \"showing a film to some people\"?",

      "text": "Probably,when you get paid. I doubt the legal screening of films in halls of any size matters as long as you don't receive some consideration for it in exchange for it. Four friends watching a movie together is hardly a cinema hall,it's a projector room at best. Do check with a professional tho",
