  "description": "Not sure if law is the right fair for this. But curious to hear that the rules and regulations are for drone use in Bangladesh - cities and the countryside. Any elevation requirements? How large is the no-fly zones around airports? Any air corridors around it? What about places like parliament? Any licences or permits needed? Notification to be given in advance? What about photography and filming - factoring in the reality you might be able to look in through windows inadvertently (or even intentionally lol)? What if for personal use? Or commercial monetisation? Or any other considerations one should take into account?\nHappy to hear about anyone else's experiences with drone use also.",

      "text": "Well I do know quite a few photographers who uses drones for filming and for wedding. Honestly nobody bother about licensing or asking for permission. Policemen won't hunt you down by the mere sight of your drone but avoid government institutes like offices and parliaments because they won't even allow a camera either. Other than that fly where you want to.",
