  "description": "So, my father passed away on 22nd July, 2025. We are applying for his death certificate online. For which, an OTP goes to his phone number which is Grameenphone (for your kind info). Now here is the problem, his phone was stolen from his janaza prayer, and so, we lost his SIM. Now, to replace the SIM, since he is dead, I need to transfer the SIM to my name and for that I need Succession Certificate and for this I need the death certificate and for death certificate, I need the SIM. I am stuck in a loop. Can anybody please help me out?",
