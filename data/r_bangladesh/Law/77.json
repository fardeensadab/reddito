  "description": "Recently, I saw a viral video of a man carrying a knife for \"self-defense\" (as he explained), while people tagged him as an \"Awami League activist\", \"Chatra League member\", and even a \"dakat\". The police eventually cuffed him.\nMy question is: What weapons can one legally carry for self-defense in Bangladesh? Additionally, is it legal to carry a concealed gun with a proper license, and what are the laws regarding that? Just to clarify, I'm asking out of curiosity and not because I have the money to buy a gun.",
