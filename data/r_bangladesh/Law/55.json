Child marriage is a thing inherently because of poverty. You can \"expect\" a boy to earn for you, but not for a girl due to societal stigmas. So it's either you perpetually take care of your daughter, which isn't possible in these households, or you marry them off.\nThis is where child marriage STEMS from.\nThis inherent \"culture\" (of marrying your daughter off early) eventually got normalized and got adopted by the entire socio-economic class in rural regions.",

Adolescent girls’ rights over 30 years\" published in March 2025, 51.4% of women in Bangladesh aged 20–24 were married before turning 18, the highest rate in Asia and 8th globally.\nI'll bet 35 or more US states don't have laws banning Bengal Tiger bones in their pancakes either.
