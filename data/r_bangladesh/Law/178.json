  "description": "Is any Income Tax expert herein the group willing to clear my doubts regarding some tax treatment in the tax file? I got seriously confused by one-word answers from experts in the Facebook group. Seems like I was hurting the community people by asking obvious questions. :/\nMy mother has only income streams from Sonchoypotro Income and FDR Interest Income at the moment.\nIs the 10% TDS deducted by the banks from FDRs can be re-adjusted using a Tax Rebate? (as shown in the picture)\nCan I treat the interest income of the un-matured FDRs as Income of the current year? Or do I have to treat it as Income when the FDR account matures?\nCan Tax Credits of the amount of BDT 60K+ be claimed in future tax assessments?\nI have these doubts considering I did proper tax calculations. If I made any mistake, please do share and correct me.\nI am just trying to learn to do this thing by myself - as everyone should.",
