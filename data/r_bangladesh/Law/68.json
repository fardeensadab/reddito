  "description": "Currently my police clearance application is at step 8/10, ready for MOFA Verification. But i got this random number with no picture and temporary message enabled telling me to visit Malibagh \"DSB\", shouldn't it be SB office with these documents. Mind you my certificate is already been signed by OC of my local thana and SP/DC from HQ. I dont live no where near Malibagh as well.\nWhen i asked his name he told SI Salauddin, but his Whatsapp name is saying Adnan Hosain and true calling is saying Akm Khan. And SB office is closed tomorrow. And he's asking for my ref number, shouldn't he already know that.\nCouple of days back i was called by another number claiming to be from dsb office for my local thana verification which doesn't make any sense. Well that one turned out to be a scammer.\nBut idk about this one. What's your thought. Normally i have never heard of visiting sb office when already they have signed my certificate.\nAny take?",
