  "description": "I want to build first floor luxury house, the idea is we have a land in tajpur near goula bazaar in sylhet, my father brought this 18 decimal land 25 year ago I am planning to build a luxury house to give on rent, I am from Uk working in a bt-ee telecom service earning £22k annually unfortunately I don’t have enough savings to start building this luxury home, ideally my main goal is to build the luxury home rent it and cover the cost from the rent and add floors each floor 3 apartments for rent eventually end up with 5 stories apartment building for rent as a form of business. However I was planning to do this by getting a loan from Bangladesh bank and paying back with the rent income is this possible with the Bangladesh bank will they approve the loan with this plan?",
