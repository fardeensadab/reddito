      "text": "Bro drinking culture is somewhat strong in Bangladesh specially for Youth(16-30s). But it's not so strong for older generation (50-90 years). Younger generation more accepting of it and there's plenty of underground bars/ legal bars. But importing goods like alcohol tends to be very costing bc of the tariffs. There's a huge market in Dhaka because there's a large amount of middle class so you can gain your profit back. I would recommend not opening a bar in rural areas bc consumption power in rural areas is very low. In the law Estates that you need to be on non Muslim to drink alcohol but majority of the people don't give a shit. You might find extremists in this subreddit but they don't represent the majority of the Bangladeshis.\nRegulation\nDrug control act 2018\nLiquor bar licence and alcohol law in Bangladesh: https://tahmidurrahman.com/liquor-bar-license-and-alcohol-law-in-bangladesh/#:~:text=Drug%20Control%20Act%20and%20Alcohol%20law%20in%20Bangladesh%3A,-Under%20the%20'Drug&text=Clubs%20and%20organisations%20with%20at,license%20to%20open%20a%20bar",

          "text": "Thank you very much for your insights! It was really helpful! Can you shed some light on the economic zones of Bangladesh? I mean how open minded they are about an export based distillery house? Bangladesh is a agrarian country and blessed with fertility, raw materials for producing alcohol should not be a problem here. And labour cost is significantly low though distillation is not a labour centric industry.",

              "text": "Economic zones of Bangladesh?\nBangladesh has several economic zones established to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. Some of the major economic zones in Bangladesh are the Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ), Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ), Karnaphuli Export Processing Zone (KEPZ), and Mongla Export Processing Zone (MEPZ). These economic zones provide duty-free import of raw materials and simplified procedures for obtaining licenses and permits. As a result, many foreign investors have set up their manufacturing facilities in these economic zones.\nHow open-minded are they about an export-based distillery house?\nIf you are exporting the majority of your goods out of Bangladesh, then you would be fine. E.g Carew & Co (nationalised company) has a strong export market in India. They have a Vertical integration Business model, which is excellent for them. Jamuna Group LTD (beer 300tka ($3)) and Heineken (250tka ($2.5) have a robust domestic market as well in Bangladesh. But Jamuna Group beer doesn’t export much. If you open an export-based distillery house, you must bribe government officials for the Liquor licence, which can be costly.\nBut opening a bar, which is a permit, then very cheap for bribes and opening costs. If you want to open up a premium bar average of $10,000-$20000. Depending on where you open. The average Wage for a minimum skilled worker is 8000 monthly ($80)(B.D Wage). I wouldn't recommend importing raw resources from outside of Bangladesh because Import tariffs are ridiculous. Barley of 1.80 tonnes costs Tk 29,000 - Tk 80,000 - ($ 250-$750) (Profitability of Barley) and Wheat is around kg (0.20) (Wheat price). And Hard Liquor, I can't give you that information because it depends on what you're looking for. Also, bit more information on the Alcohol consumption rate for Bangladesh(Consumption rate 2010). Information for the consumption rate is a bit old (2010), but The consumption rate is much higher so take it with a grain of salt. I would like to add that there is a strong community of moonshiners in Bangladesh, Best shit I have ever drunk.\nReference\n(B.D Wage)\nhttps://take-profit.org/en/statistics/wages/bangladesh/#:~:text=Minimum%20Wages%20in%20Bangladesh%20remained,published%20Yearly%20by%20Employment%20Ministry.\nProfitability of Barley.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/339301672_Profitability_of_barley_cultivation_in_selected_areas_of_Bangladesh\nWheat price\nhttps://www.tridge.com/intelligences/wheat/BD/price\n(Consumption rate 2010)\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Alcohol-consumption-among-adults-in-Bangladesh%3A-Islam-Zaman/fac9b6a70b822520029d07e1b000e2506cc7ba8d",

But the competition in this field is minimum. So, the profit could be substantial. Then again, you'll be targeting less than 1% of the population",
