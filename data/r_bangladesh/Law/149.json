  "description": "I am Canadian, currently living in Canada, married to a Bengali. His entire family is also in Canada, however his father does own land back home. They are currently trying to sell such land, and have acquired a buyer. Here is the issue, the land is under my father in laws name, my father in law is in no state to travel to Bangladesh or even sign any papers as he recently suffered from a stroke and has been in the hospital. Is there any way we could have the land sold, does my mother in law have any right to sell this land and act for my sick father in law?",
