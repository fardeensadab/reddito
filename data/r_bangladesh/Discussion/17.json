  "description": "Hi! I’m working on a small gaming-related business and I’m looking for someone who currently lives in Turkey to help with a simple game account buying task (nothing sensitive or risky).\nIt mainly involves checking or accessing region-only offers/content and buying the account for me.\nIt’s completely safe and legal.I will pay for the account and a small payment for your time.\nIf you live in Turkey or India and are interested, please comment or DM me.\nThanks!",
