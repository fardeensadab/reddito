  "description": "Suppose it's 2 am at night and you are no where near to sleep when,\nYou lost your phone yesterday, and with the month’s end approaching, buying a new phone isn’t something you can even think about right now. Your number is off you don't have any other device to use. The room is completely dark, and the only sound is your roommate’s quiet breathing after a long, exhausting day. He needs to wake up at 6 a.m. in the next morning, so turning on the light is not an option.\nIn that stillness, with no light, no distractions, and no way to reach anyone, what would you do in that moment?",
