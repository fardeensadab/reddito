  "description": "Hello everyone. I have applied as a lecturer for the RME (robotics and mechatronics)dept of Daffodil University. I just wanted to know did any of you applied there as well and if so did you receive any email for the written exam/ interview anything. Actually quite a few days have passed since the deadline and I've heard that the SWE dept applicants have already received a call. So I was wondering if I wasn't selected or they just didn't start calling yet. TIA.",
