  "description": "I don't understand the point of studying in Bangladesh like it's all memorising and teachers aren't even that talented except some. Students study because they fear the societal judgement not because they really want to or feel curious about. Literally Bangladesh's education system ruins people's spark and curiosity. Literally I'm so freaking sleep deprived that I experienced hallucinations...I hate Bangladesh's education system it doesn't teach you nothing other than memorising and taking suggestions and writing the same shit copy pasted A to Z...it only kills a mind more than it grows a mind.",
