  "description": "Thinking of visiting the uttor bongo in this winter. I don’t have any friends or relatives there. So I was thinking is there any hotels in Tetulia? I know it’s not a fancy place to tour, but just for the sake of exploring we are doing this. We will be a 6 friends group, don’t have much expectation that we will be seeing some insane place there. So would you recommend any place that we should must consider to visit? And is it a good time to see Kanchanjongha?",
