  "description": "Hello everyone, I need serious advice on the quickest and most flexible way to obtain my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC). My goal is to finish the entire exam process (all subjects) and pass the board exam within approximately 12 months. My Background & Constraints: Goal: Complete HSC in 1 year. Preferred Group: Science is ideal, but l am prepared to switch to Humanities or Commerce if that group offers a more realistic path for a 1-year completion. Education Gap: I have a significant 4-year break since passing Class 10 (SSC/ equivalent). 2024-2025 batch from a vocational school. Work Schedule: This is the biggest challenge. I work a fixed night shift from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. I am only available for classes/studying during the daytime/morning. Group Recommendation: Based on my time constraint, would Commerce or Humanities be a more manageable syllabus to complete in 1 year compared to Science?\nAlso l need some career advice as Well 一Wanted to be a software engineer or at least a computer science background, it's my passion. But I don't think | can do it with commerce or humanities But anyways thanks",
