  "description": "Nowadays every single store seems copy pasted multiple times. Take new market for example every single shop sells the same basic stuff. Its really hard to look unique here unless u buy from online(which my dad doesnt like)\nAnd whats with everyone and their Pinterest fashion taste. Bruh we are stuck with old money and baggy clothes its like ppl dont know other ways of dressing exists. Some idiots think if u wear baggy u got style, that shouldn't be the case. The width and cut of someones pants cant decide if u have swag or not.\nI mean yea i wear baggy jeans too cuz im skinny fat and u wear it cuz u dont know what u are doing we are simply not the same.\nAnd mark my words in this FW25 arka u will see lots of cornballs wearing leopard print,all black fits cuz they cant mix colours and some bs thats absolutely absurd. Oh yea and whole bunch of fake a** accents. Ts pmo ngl. They dont got personal style they just copy paste others and then everyone ends up looking the same.\nSo erm yea lemme know if im tripping(dont bother interacting with this if i mentioned ur type u think yk what u are doing but u dont)\nAnd gimme some actually good and cheap places to shop. byeeeeee",
