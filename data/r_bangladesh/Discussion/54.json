  "description": "Amar obostha ekdom tragic — sob ghee ekhon same: plastic’r shaad . Every jar tastes like someone melted candle wax and whispered “original ghee” over it.\nI want that kid-days-level ghee. The one that used to hit your nostrils from 2 rooms away. The one that made bhaat, daal, dim-bhuna, everything taste like childhood was still useful.\nBut now?\n99% vejal olympics.\nPure ghee? More like “purified disappointment.”\nSo Reddit bhai-bon-ra…\nKon brand actually PURE?\nLike… jaw-dropping, mind-exploding, smells-like-gaon’er-goru level PURE?\nI’m talking the type of ghee that makes you doubt your own kitchen choices…\nThe type that makes your neighbors cry because they smell it and realize their entire life is a lie.\nPlease drop recommendations before I lose hope and start churning butter with my own sadness. 😭🧈",
