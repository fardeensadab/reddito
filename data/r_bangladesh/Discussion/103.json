  "description": "I know discord servers are ofc already made of socialising. But the reason I wanna make one is for people who feel disconnected from society ig? People who also don't like the trendy stuff at bd. Wanna explore less popular stuff here and instead try other stuff may that be niches or smth that's just popular in foreign. Ik it's a vague description somewhat but I just wanna try smth new and meet/interract w new people. May as well try smth new instead of sitting around sulking yk?",
