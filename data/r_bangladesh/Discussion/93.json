  "title": "KORAIL FIRE are slum dwellers in Dhaka just “collateral damage” of urban growth? 🏙️🔥",
  "description": "Last week’s fire in Korail slum — one of Dhaka’s largest and most densely populated informal settlements — destroyed more than 1,500 shanties and left thousands homeless overnight. AP News+1\nMany of these residents are climate refugees or people who moved from rural regions hoping to find dignity and opportunity in the city. AP News Their lives are already precarious — now the fire has torn away shelters, memories, and safety nets.\nBut here’s the thing: this isn’t just an “accident.” Narrow alleys, haphazard housing, lack of fire-safety measures — these are part of a broken urban system that keeps neglecting the people who built this city from the bottom up.\nIf we call ourselves a “growing city,” then we must ask: as Dhaka expands, who pays the price for that growth? Who protects people whose housing is informal — but whose lives matter no less than anyone else’s?\nI think this tragedy highlights deep structural inequality: the slum residents are the backbone of city life (servants, rickshaw drivers, cleaners, workers...) yet get the least protection, the least voice, the least support.\nWe need real urban-planning reforms, affordable housing, better emergency response in slum zones — and public recognition that these vulnerable communities are part of Dhaka, not outside of it.\nWhat do you all think: does the government / city planning care about slum-dwellers at all? Or are disasters like the Korail fire just a reminder that we need bigger social changes?",
