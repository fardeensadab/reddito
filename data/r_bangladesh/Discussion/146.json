  "title": "Are These Daily Earthquakes in Bangladesh Really Natural?",
  "description": "In Bangladesh there are earthquakes almost every day now, and it doesn’t even feel “natural” anymore — it feels man-made. If that’s the case, then why would Dhaka University give a 15-day holiday? The epicenters are also showing up in the same areas again and again, and even quakes are happening in restricted places like the sea.whats your thoughts about it?",

If you loot at Bangladesh Earthquakes history I think the major earthquake on Dhaka where majority felt it made people on the edge.\n3/4 megnitute Earthquakes happened before but didn't make such headline since there wasn't any major one in Dhaka to wake people up.\nSo much frequency is concerning. What's interesting is that the fault line that we should be concerned about didn't create the recent 5.7Mw earthquake. It was a completely undiscovered fault line.",
