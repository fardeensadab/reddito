You need to buy them here to cope up with the winter.\nFor T-shirt and Jeans, I prefer Infinity/Richman and Artisan. I’ve found their quality of products unbeatable at that price range compared to EU. For winter clothes, I recommend Artisan only. For shoes, I recommend anything as no matter what brand you choose, they aren’t as good as shoes here.\nNo need to buy a lot of stuff in BD. You can buy them here and the cost is similar to BD in the same quality.",
