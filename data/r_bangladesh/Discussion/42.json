  "description": "I’m curious if anyone else has gone through something like this.\nI spent about 4 months four rounds interviewing with a major international engineering company based in Korea. Multiple rounds, technical interviews — everything. In December 2024, I finally received and signed the official contract. It was even signed by one of their top executives. The job was global, with onboarding planned at their HQ in Seoul.\nBecause of embassy delays, my document attestation took a while, but I submitted everything in January 2025. After that, I expected things to move forward.\nInstead… nothing.\nAt first, the recruiter replied through WhatsApp, saying the company was undergoing “restructuring” and waiting for updates from the project team. But over time the messages became less frequent, and now I haven’t heard anything at all — no replies to emails, texts, or calls.\nSo now I’m stuck in this strange limbo: I have a signed contract, but no onboarding, no visa, and no official communication for months.\nHas anyone else ever faced this with a Korean company — long process, signed contract, then total silence? Would love to hear your experiences or advice.",
