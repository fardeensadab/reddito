They'll charge you almost 100% of the total price for your product. i'm not sure if it's an option for you, but if possible, bring the product with DHL. Then you can call dhl helpline asking what your customs duty will be.\ni.e. I brought a laptop worth around $1480 with DHL, where my customs duty was 60k BDT which i paid through DHL (C&F agent asked 130k BDT as customs duty)",
