  "description": "Hi everyone, I need some information. I will be traveling to Bangladesh soon through Dhaka Airport, and I want to bring 2 new mobile phones for my family. I also have 2 personal phones that I use myself.\nIs it allowed to carry these 4 phones in total, or will there be any issues at immigration? It would be very helpful if anyone has any information or recent experience regarding this.",
