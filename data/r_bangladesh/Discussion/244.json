But that was BNP’s failure basically.\nIf designed well with good intentions, it’ll definitely work. After all, it’s our only hope.\nAlso, it’s possible that the EC will takeover the administration and governance for 3 months and exit after holding the election. I’m assuming the EC will be independent, honest and transparent.",
