  "description": "Hello .. I’m just curious as someone living abroad: What degree are you studying, how much are you paying for it, and how much do you expect to earn after graduating? Do you think you’ll be able to get a job without nepotism or bribery? I know that these days people can earn money using a computer even without a degre, how u actually works, what skills u learned??",
