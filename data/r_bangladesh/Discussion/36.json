  "description": "As we wrap up 2025 and gear up for an epic 2026, it's time to hit pause and reflect! I've got 20 powerful questions to help you celebrate wins, learn from the bumps, and set intentions for what's next.\nGrab a journal, a coffee, and let's dive in and answer one (or all!) in the comments below. Which one hits home for you?\nWhat was your biggest accomplishment this year? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? What moments brought you the most joy? What did you learn about yourself this year? Who made a positive impact on your life, and how did they help you? What are you most grateful for as the year ends? How did you spend your time, and did it align with your priorities? What habits served you well, and which ones didn’t? What are you proud of that you didn’t expect to achieve? If you could sum up this year in one word, what would it be? What do you want more of in the new year? What is one habit or routine you’d like to start in 2026? What are your top three priorities for the year ahead? How will you take care of your mental and physical health in 2026? What are you excited to learn or try this year? What is one thing you’ll say no to in the new year? How will you make time for the people who matter most? What is one way you can be kinder to yourself in 2026? If 2026 is your dream year, what happens? What is your guiding word or phrase for the year?",
