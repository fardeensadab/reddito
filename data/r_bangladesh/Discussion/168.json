  "description": "Hello, I am from the UK and would like to ride my bicycle from the Indian-Bangladesh border towards Dhaka. I’m struggling to find clear information about which visa I need. I know I can apply for a Bangladesh visa beforehand in a big city in Nepal or India, but would like to get visa on arrival ideally.\nIs that possible when crossing the land border (the border near Siliguri preferably).\nThank you!",

Please use the same port for both entry and departure. Individuals from countries subject to official bans, however, do not qualify for Visa on Arrival (VOA) or Landing Permit (LP).\nSource: https://voa.specialbranch.gov.bd/public/voa-info.html",

But if you do find one, just know that bus drivers and larger vehicles can be often ruthless and not mindful of smaller vehicles in the bigger roads towards and outwards from Dhaka. Taking caution of incoming traffic both ways is highly advised especially for a bicyclist. Be watchful and cautious at a distance. Good luck.",
