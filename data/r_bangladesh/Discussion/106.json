  "description": "I’m trying to book a ticket with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, but my passport is currently expired and I’m waiting for the new one to arrive.\nWhen I tried to enter my expired passport info on the Biman website, it wouldn’t accept the expired date. The system only allows future expiry dates.\nCan I enter a temporary placeholder expiry date just to complete the booking, and then email them later to update it once I get my new passport?\nHas anyone done this before? Will this cause any issues during check-in?",
