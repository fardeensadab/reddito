  "description": "So I’ve been trying to learn business lately e-commerce, trading, investments, all that. And honestly man, I didn’t expect it to feel this confusing. Everyone online makes it look so simple: “start a store,” “learn marketing,” “just be consistent,” but when you’re actually sitting down trying to understand everything step by step… it hits different.\nI’m 21, trying to figure out my life, trying to build something real. But every time I start learning, I feel overwhelmed. Too many paths, too much information, and no one to guide me in real life. I feel like I’m fighting my own thoughts half the time, like I want to improve, I want to build a business, but I don’t even know where to start anymore.\nIf anyone else struggled like this in the beginning, how did you push through? How did you stay focused and actually understand things instead of just getting lost in information?\nAny advice would help. I just want to learn the right way and build something meaningful.",
