Some might like more democracy within AL and BNP, some might like other parties to come up, some people would prefer a Singaporean style single partly government, some a Pakistani regime with military control, others an Islamic republic.\nBut just wanting Hasina and Khaleda gone does not make it happen, as it not happen the last time the army was in charge. The main reason it will happen is because Hasina discredited AL badly with her governance and BNP is lead by Tarique who wants to be the PM while staying in London.",
