  "description": "I am a final year student of CSE background with good cgpa from a public engineering university. I am not good at programming and didn’t pay attention to web development either. Have good knowledge in machine learning and have some good works. If I want to get a job at Robi, GP, Huawei Bangladesh or any companies like these, which qualifications should i need to have and how to prepare for those jobs? And what type of jobs they offer where I can apply as an CSE graduate?\nPlease help me. Thanks",
