Overall the institutions in Bangladesh are very weak, which have been even weakened further during 2008-2024 governments.\nAs a recent example think about the battery rickshaws in road. These rickshaws are dangerous and bad for the public safety but could the government take them out from the road?\nAlso did you know 0 restaurants in Dhaka meet the RAJUK's fire safety guidelines in Dhaka? Now if RAJUK tries to close the restaurants all restaurants needs to be closed.\nOn the building safety I remember Aupi Karim (actress and architect) mentioned most of the Dhaka's buildings need to be demolished to bring them to meet safety. Will the residents let the government follow through the policies?",
