  "description": "Hi, I'm pretty new to this subreddit, but i have wanted to ask something that's been bugging me out for a while.\nFor context; I was born in Bangladesh, moved to Germany with my parents when i was 1 year old, and when i was 3 years old we settled in Norway where I've basically grown up here for 15 years. It is VERY rare for me to randomly meet a Bengali that i do not know of unless if it's someone that my family know of (I.e. If there's another family that's inviting us over).\nSo my question is, are there any Bengalis that are in the same boat as me or know anyone that live in countries where the Bangladeshi population isn't that big?",
