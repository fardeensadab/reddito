  "description": "Hey guys, I need some advice from people who’ve been through this.\nI live in Dhaka and I’ve got a pretty hectic admission schedule in January 2026.\n15 Jan: KUET admission test → I have to go to Khulna on 14 Jan\n16 Jan: Rajshahi University exam → My center is in Dhaka.\n17 Jan: CUET admission test → I have to go to Chittagong, and I’ve never been there either\nI don’t have any relatives in Khulna or Chittagong, and I’ve never visited these cities before. I’ll be going with a few friends who are also giving the exams.\nWhat I need help with:\nWhat will be the best way to travel?\nWhere should we stay in Khulna and Chittagong for one night? Looking for something safe, clean, and budget-friendly for students somewhere that’s convenient for reaching to the exam centers.\nIf anyone has done this route before, or has any tips for dealing with this kind of tight exam schedule (travel + rest + safety), please drop your advice.\nWould really appreciate it!",
