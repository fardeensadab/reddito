  "description": "I'm thinking of taking my partner from the UK to Sylhet and we will stay in a nice hotel. We are not married. Is there things I need to consider before going? Could be obvious some could not. Just need an idea what to expect. Will want to try tourist things rather than visit family so maybe a tour guide that could arrange travel to see different parts. Is there a service for that?",
