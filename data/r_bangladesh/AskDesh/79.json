  "description": "Are there any bike rentals in banshkhali Chittagong? Me and my friends are planning a tour this winter. And we wanted to rent some bikes there. But we don't know if there are any rentals over there. We are mostly wanting to rent TVS RTR 160 4V, SUZUKI FI ABS, YAMAHA R15. Will there be any rentals over there? If anyone knows please tell me. It will be really of help if anyone can tell if we can find any rentals over there. And if anyone knows how much will it cost for 10-12 hours.",
