  "description": "I took a long time off of office and in the blink of any eye, some of it is gone.\nI need a lil bit of a refresher and want to go somewhere for maybe 2-3 Days.\nAny suggestions folks?\nI'd love to go somewhere that's serene and chill out. Don't say Cox Bazar as I don't want that bus commute and train tickets are not available atm.\nI have heard good stuff about Sreemangal but the roads are apparently ass.\nAnyhoo, for me it'd be a solo trip I guess. Budget would be around 10k or more if needed.\nAny and all suggestions are appreciated.\nThank you!",

Roamed around rajshahi university, rajshahi college, tbad, puthia rajbari and missed the varendra musuem since it was closed.\nI did take a flight and stayed at a ngo training center! However train tix are 800. Puthia rajbari is a little far and not sure abt the transport fix (we drove)",
