  "title": "Which churches in Bangladesh conduct marriages without requiring a baptism certificate?",
  "description": "Basically, my friend is a non-returning Bangladeshi who wants to marry in Bangladesh because his family is there. He wants a church wedding for cultural reasons. He was raised as a Christian but is no longer religious and has no baptism certificate. His relatives claim a baptism certificate is mandatory for a Christian marriage in Bangladesh. Is that true? He does not want to get baptized solely to meet that requirement. His family is not Catholic (I am not sure of their exact denomination). He wants to know which churches (regardless of denomination) or if any specific priests in Bangladesh perform Christian marriages without requiring proof of baptism. His to-be bride also has no baptism certificate. Any info on this is appreciated!",
