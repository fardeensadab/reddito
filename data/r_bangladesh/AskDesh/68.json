The port productivity needs to be increased several folds.\nSome people don’t like it because:\n⁠They can not earn corruption money\n⁠Many operations will be automated and some people may lose jobs if they don’t lean the new technologies.\n⁠There is existing an inefficient overhead of people in the port who don’t add much value but still in the job. They can lose jobs.\nThey are putting their highest energy (Sorbo shokti) to undermine this deal.",
