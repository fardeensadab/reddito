  "description": "Hey folks, I hope you are doing well. This question is for those who are residing in Australia. The validity of my passport is ending in June next year and I intend to renew it. Currently I am living in Adelaide, Australia and I intend to renew my visa in that country. When I searched it up, it stated that an appointment is mandatory for the passport renewal and I have to make an appointment at Canberra. However, one of my friends who renewed his passport didn't have to travel all the way and got it sorted just by submitting the required documents online. I could not find any option to finish my application without making an appointment at Canberra. Please let me know what I can do about it. Thank you.",
