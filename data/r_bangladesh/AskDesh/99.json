  "description": "Are there any chances of another earthquake happening like the one today? I have been hearing many people saying that something like a aftershock or a mainshock will happen. If another earthquak happens will it be a small or a big one? I have also seen many news accounts say that a 9 magnitude earthquake might happen.",

The magnitude-9 one people always parrot is from studies done already a decade prior [1]. Currently we can only forecast which regions are risky and roughly how strong a possible earthquake would be. But that can be occur today, tomorrow or maybe 100 years later.",
