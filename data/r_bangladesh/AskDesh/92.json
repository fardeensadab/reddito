  "description": "I’m M20, student, and honestly, I've lived through more than I should've at this age. For years I was numb, detached, almost heartless. People treated me like dirt, and I carried that bitterness everywhere. But July uprising changed me. For the first time, I understood what a country actually means. What its people are worth. Watching ordinary citizens stand up to raw injustice, watching people die right in front of us… that broke something open in me. That's when my hatred for injustice became real. That's when I started caring about struggles beyond my own like Gaza and other oppressed people everywhere. July uprising made the world look a lot darker, but it also made the truth unavoidable. And in the middle of all that sacrifice and suffering, I watched a certain class of shameless, self-serving parasites in this country. They saw the Awami League's cruelty, yet still chase their own tiny interests like everything is fine. Their behavior is terrifying for this nation and its future. They've never lost anything, so they don't care what the people lose. After 16 months of watching them up close, my anger toward this society came back. But it made something crystal clear that my love for this country never died. I'm just surrounded by a class of worms pretending to be citizens. Honestly, I have more affection for some street dogs than for those people.",
