  "description": "Hey everyone!\nI’m planning a remote-work trip to Dhaka, Bangladesh soon and would love some local insight. I’ll be working online during my stay, so I’m looking for recommendations on:\n• Safe, comfortable areas to stay (preferably close to amenities, good internet, and easy transport) • Cafés, coworking spaces, or quiet spots that are reliable for remote work • Neighborhoods with affordable short-term apartments or Airbnbs\nI’ll be working full-time remotely, so stable WiFi is a big priority. Any advice on mobile data options or ISPs for temporary travelers is also super helpful!\nAdditionally, I’m open to hiring a Virtual Assistant, preferably someone based in Dhaka. Tasks would include scheduling, basic admin, online research, and communication support. If you or someone you know might be a good fit, feel free to reach out.\nThanks in advance! Any guidance from locals or frequent visitors would be much appreciated. 🙏🏽",
