  "description": "so, a few weeks ago, i was in Bangladesh. CTG to be specific. i met lots of Muslim people. Some Hindu people, and even some people from Buddhism. but not a single Christian. i didn't even see a single church, either. so, where are they? do they even exist in BD? i have a lot of friends from BD, and most of them are Muslim. i also have Christian friends from Canada, but not a single one from bd. I've never met a Christian from bd either😑. i wanna know about their culture in bd. i wanna know how they celebrate Christmas or Halloween. so, anyone wanna answer my question here?btw, im a non believer 👀",

I live near a Christian school in bashundhara (Dhaka) and just the other day found out there is a church besides IUB sports ground. Both are very concealed in nature. Also festivals like Halloween aren't really Christian in nature but small activities do happen (in elite and privileged circles only). Christmas decor stuff happens in churches but that's about it.",

Lot's of people who are not catholic even have normal Bangladeshi surnames like Majumdar, Das, Mondol blah blah blah.\nHalloween isn't celebrated, maybe some people who live in Dhaka do that, but that's definitely not a religious festival.\nUnlike most I have a westernized Middle Eastern name, lot's of people still assume I'm Muslim.\n(Even though I refereed Christians as `us`, I myself is not believer for a long time.)",

My whole family has portugese sounding last names -Gomes,Dias,D’Costa. Really rare in the grand scheme of BD, But our little community runs deep. The church in my village is from the 1800s and still has the same architecture. I was raised in the U.S so growing up i thought it was fairly normal. But nowadays everytime i tell someone I’m bengali catholic they get super shocked lol.",

U can visit the armenian church in dhaka....again its not like that's all there is.... Its only the ones that i personally know of.... I worked as a special education teacher in a christian missionary school specialising for blind students....\nAnd Christmas yes it is celebrated well...but it doesnt have the sheer cultural and social vibrance like in the west....in the west Christmas is huge....the economics surrounding it....the snowfall...the santa and his reindeers.....the gifts....specially the gifts.... Im used to seeing videos of kids getting their favourite toy for gift in christmas in the west....that doesnt quite happen here....\nIts more about being happy that jesus christ was born... Praying to him for whatever people want love and care about....\nAs far as halloween goes...that is more like a cosplay event... Only done by rich kids mostly.....neither Muslims nor christians see it as something to be celebrated.....the overall fabric of our society is still quite conservative....\nGood thing u didnt ask about hey why u dont guys have thanksgiving?.... Are yall ungrateful?.... Do u pardon the turkey or not?? Lol\nEdit: **Also just remembered there are a lot of tribal people in Chittagong who are christians...",
