  "description": "Hsc 2026 batch here and recently I have been wondering about lot about what subject to apply for in uni. After a careful consideration of my likings and circumstances, I have decided upon Geography&Enviorment, Public Administration and International Relationships. Though the other subjects sounds good themselves i have a bigger interest in IR. Any IR students here who can tell me more about the subject?? What expect n stuff? Maybe simply your experience as an IR student??",
