  "description": "Hello,\nI am looking for wedding photographers based on Chittagong. So far, as i have looked into photographers with beautiful portfolio, most of them are based in Dhaka. In those cases, if I add transportation and accommodation cost, it will double my expenses. So, I am asking for your recommendations for photographers based on Chittagong.\nMy Preferences for photography is a bit classic/natural, not too colorful/over saturated pictures.",
