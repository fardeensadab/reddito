  "description": "Hi everyone,\nI’m visiting Bangladesh soon and had a quick question. I’ll be landing in Dhaka (DAC) from Dubai on Emirates around 8:20 AM — but realistically, if there’s a delay, maybe closer to 9:00 AM.\nI have a US-Bangla domestic flight at 11:40 AM from Dhaka to my hometown.\nWould 2.5–3 hours be enough time to clear immigration, collect baggage, and catch my domestic flight? Any tips or recent experiences would be really appreciated!",
