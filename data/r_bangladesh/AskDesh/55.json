I walked on the roads, spent time in the ground floor lounge, smoked outside, ate food in canteens or in Tasty Treat, read books and newspapers. (Can't roam in all floors as it's a private hospital)\nThere's not much else to do tbh but it really gave me time for inner reflection as I was in a very bad situation personally. I hope you get lpast this.",
