  "description": "I am soon starting an online business and looking for a warehouse management system that would work in Bangladesh. Something simple, mainly to add products, create orders, and simply track from packed, to shipped till delivered. Maybe generate invoices for the order. Something simple.\nIs there anything like that? Maybe some of you guys are using something similar. If you are, please let me know what you guys are using.\nI've checked at Zoho Inventory, but it's not suitable for me as it adds too many layers.",
