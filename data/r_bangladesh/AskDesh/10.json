  "description": "My homegirl and I are planning for a trip in the mountains(Either Sylhet but preferably CTG). And I know it might be a little bit risky, considering we are still very young in our 20s, and have never been out in the woods-but see it as a sort of existential awakening.\nWe don't wish to spend an exuberant amount of money on transportation and high five hotels and generally the plan is to reconnect with nature as much and taking as much pictures. We also want to go for places that aren't heavily commercialised. But given that I've never been around,specially not in such off grid places,I'm a little clueless as to where to go, what do to and what precautions and timings to keep in mind. I have plans to Hike and camp in trails but unsure if it's widely plausible and done in Bangladesh or if it's safe for 2 lonely women,but hey,I'd like to know regardless.\nI'd love you thoughts and opinions,love you",
