  "description": "Hello, I need some information about obtaining police clearance certificate.\nI live abroad and I am trying to get police clearance certificate for my elderly mother who lives alone in Bangladesh. She managed to make the application for it online with the help of a cousin and the application is complete. However they have only given her a eApostille document from which the original certificate can be viewed online. My mother has been advised by this cousin that this is the only document she will receive and not the actual certificate.\nIs it possible to get the hard copy? I believe the original certificate is with the local police department as they were the ones who signed and stamped it. If I ask her to travel to the police station will they give it to her? She is old and not able to walk for too long so don’t want to send her on a goose chase without being sure.\nThank you in advance.",
