  "title": "Looking for a book title, most probably by Humayun Ahmed.",
  "description": "This book was from around mid 90’s. So my memory is kinda hazy. Most probably it was written by Humayun Ahmed. If thats the case then its one of his lesser known work. I asked what I remember to chatgpt. Though story line is kinda correct, but the title is not. Here is the response:\nThe novel is about a distant planet where intelligent beings live.\n👽 The special thing about the aliens:\nThey:    •   Have hands as their main tool of intelligence    •   Can create anything just by using their hands    •   Their hands function almost like brain + tools combined    •   They don’t depend on machines like humans    •   Their civilization evolved differently — their hands became more important than their minds\nThey can:    •   Build objects instantly    •   Reshape matter    •   Create complex tools without factories    •   Treat hands like a living fabrication device Almost like biological 3D printers.\nIf you happen to remember the name of the novel please let me know, will be highly appreciated.",
