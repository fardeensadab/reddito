  "description": "Hey y’all, so… I’ll be honest — I’ve never been into politics. Anytime I see political stuff online, I just scroll past it because it feels like too much drama or I just don’t get it. 😅\nBut lately I keep seeing everyone talking about political stuff nonstop — and I have no idea what’s going on. Like… what’s the tea?? What did I miss??",
