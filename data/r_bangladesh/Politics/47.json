That's what I heard these years, what those housewives and mother's told my mother.\nI have seen a few only children who are female and they are all high-achieving and quite social.  Most are very close to their cousins and have many friends because they have no siblings. From that they develop good social skills from young age because they've no other choice except going home to an empty house with no brothers or sisters.",
