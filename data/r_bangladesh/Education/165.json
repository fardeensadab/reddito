  "description": "I'm currently a hsc candidate. I know that getting scholarships for higher studies in universities abroad is easier if you are going for a post graduation degree. But I just want to know- are there universities that offer full scholarships to foreign fresher students (I don't know if fresher is the right word- I meant students who haven't graduated- or haven't gotten admitted to any university yet)? And what are their requirements? I don't really have good grades in college.. but I think I'll get a GPA 5 in hsc?? But from what I noticed they mostly ask for school grades, not the boards. So I'm worried..I've got good grades till only class 8 lol. I have a GPA 5 in ssc tho, but as I said, I don't think they ask for boards marks. I also don't have any achievements in extra curriculars (because of strict parents who don't let me do anything else other than studying), but I'm really good at badminton (but I don't have any achievements as I never participated in any competitions). I heard extracurricular is a crucial part of their requirements.. can I still get scholarships in any universities abroad that take students without extracurricular activites and great grades? I will try to get good scores at SAT.. And universities from any country actually, but most preferably universities of US, UK, Australia, Canada, Korea and Germany. Mentioning the universities' names would be very helpful too..",
