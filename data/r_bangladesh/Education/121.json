My personal preferences are any English spoken countries .\nCan i expect to get a scholarship in the USA or anywhere else MS/phD .\nI dont know , is this even the appropriate place to post this but i guess people in this reddit are active and well aware so posting anyway .\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated .",

      "text": "Yes, you should be able to get funding for PhD in US. Get GRE soon, adminssion application deadline is usually December for next July/Aug session. Find a few universities in different ranks in world ranking in US (ie 1 from 1-10, 1 from 10-100, 1 from 101-200, 1 from 201-400) and read the admission process/criteria in their websites.\nAlso talk to your university alumni who went for PhD before. And find Facebook group for higher education.\nAlthough, asking question is not bad, but asking low effort question is. What I am telling you should be available through a few Google search. Even you can talk to AI bots like ChatGPT, Google Gemini etc. This will help you in your research/career in the future.",

          "text": "I have asked Alumni of my university , a few of my colleagues as well . They have publications so i couldn't relate with them . I was expecting to find people who don't have publications yet gotten a scholarship . I asked chatgpt all possible types of questions . Chatgpt answered affirmative . But i was concerned as major scholarships dont directly ask for publications but as there are so many highly qualified candidates have publications , so maybe there could be some hidden criteria where i dont fit well . Which is why i ended up asking real peoples here .\nBtw thanks for answering .",
