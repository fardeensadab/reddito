  "description": "So my cousin completed his matriculation and intermediate from Kuwait under CBSE board of Indian curriculum, and now he wants to apply for BBA in BRACU. Does anyone here know where he can get his equivalency done within 3 days asap? It’s really urgent though because he wants to get admitted to a uni quickly before the chaos of election.",
