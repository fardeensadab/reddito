  "description": "Assalamu Alaikum, I'm an admission student currently trying for B & D units in public varsity's but due to my family's financial situation I can't afford to do coaching or buy online courses. I'm from Science background and I don't know from where to study...everything kind of seems hopeless and hard by my self and I find it difficult to understand most topics of bangla,english and gk...If anyone can suggest from where I can watch free admission videos? I have seen a video uploaded by\nAdmission Drill (নির্ভর গ্রুপ) in which he finished the whole Bangla grammar for admission in a single 17hr long video.... I am looking exactly this kind of videos for English and gk too if anyone can help me.... I would be thankful...",
