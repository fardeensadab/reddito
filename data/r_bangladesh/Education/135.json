  "title": "where to do IBA Admission coaching",
  "description": "I’m really confused about where to prepare for the IBA admission. Every day I get a different suggestion. Some recommend Magnus, Blueprint, Mentors, or ACS, while others suggest large batches run by individual students. Even within those options, opinions vary widely.I can’t afford a personal tutor, so which coaching option should be my go to destination? (please be very honest)",
