  "description": "hey,i just started uni (CSE) and honestly my linkedin is kind empty. i want to make it something that’ll help me later for internships, projects, open source contribution, research opportunities, maybe get noticed for something.\nbut like… what am i even supposed to put on there this early? is it cringe to post when you’re just learning? or is that better than silence and post all the certificates and achievements, semester results?\nwould love advice from people who started early and made it work. what helped you stand out and network with people, get referrals and other opportunities unlocked?\nI am currently focusing on Competitive Programming.\nAlso, If you have any other cse related advice please drop it. I will appreciate it very much.\nthanks in advance",
