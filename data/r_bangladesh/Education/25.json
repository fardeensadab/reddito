  "description": "So I got registered for admission in BracU for EEE but a lot of people have been discouraging me to not study for EEE in bracU. Why is that? I know a lot of people will tell me for AUST and AIUB but, I want to know why people are discouraging me for BracU EEE.\nThose who are studying in bracU, can you tell me why there's so much negativity about bracU EEE? Is it hard to pull a good CGPA? Is it the most peer pressure giving Department? or what is it basically?",
