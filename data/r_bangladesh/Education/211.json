  "description": "What do you guys think of the intermediate level education system in our country. I personally think it's one of the worst.\ninstead of buying books from different publications I think the government should publish the book like ict, Bangla English. (Literally they are some new details in every book of different publication)\nI also think the book publication companies adding new detail every year in the book to sell their book. (I was comparing the books of 2016 and 2025, specially biology and chemistry, the details will be clear of daylight)\nAnd I also think the intermediate level time should be 2.4-2.6 years to complete all the subjecs properly.\nI am HSC 2026 candidate with below average IQ.",
