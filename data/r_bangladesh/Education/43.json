  "description": "I (19M) passed my hsc this year and currently I'm preparing for my admission tests. I aspire to become a theoretical physicist, but I think I should know more about what higher education in physics in like in BD. If anyone here is majoring/majored in physics, I'd love to talk to you if you have the time. Thanks :)",

It's best to ask for advices like this in Facebook instead of here, you can ask of the Dhaka sub too, but Facebook would still be the better option.\nI'd advise you to go and look up groups that might be relevant to what information you need.",
