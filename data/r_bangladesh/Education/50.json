  "description": "Hi everyone, I’m a student from HSC 25 batch, and trying to understand my options for studying Mechanical Engineering in New Zealand.\nMy academic background:\nSSC: GPA 5.00 (science)\nHSC: GPA 5.00 (Science)\nWhat I need help with:\nIs New Zealand worth it for a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering?\nWhich universities have strong ME programs, labs, hands-on work, internships, and good job opportunities later?\nMy budget is around 30–32 lakh BDT/year for tuition. Are there universities within this range?\nI heard University of Canterbury has great engineering, but the weather might be too cold. How difficult is it to adjust?\nHow good is Auckland University of Technology for Mechanical Engineering?\nAre part-time jobs enough to cover living costs as a student?\nOr should I consider Australia instead for Mechanical Engineering and PR opportunities?",

Could you tell me why natives are leaving NZ? Is it job opportunities, cost of living? Or something else? Because I want to know the realistic image before taking such a huge decision. And I'm comparing NZ with Australia too",
