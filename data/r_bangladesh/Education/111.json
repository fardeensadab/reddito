  "description": "If your family is unable to support your education at any Dhaka school/college then you can knock me. I will pay your school/college tuition fees, any exam fees when needed.\nAt the moment I can’t support private university students, however public university/affiliated college honours/masters student from Dhaka may contact me as well.\nCatch is I will not pay the money to you. I will pay school/college directly. If you need any books/stationaries, I will buy those books/stationaries on behalf of you. This is to ensure that money is spent on education and not for personal use.\nWhy am I doing this? In our religion we are encouraged to help people in need. zakat is there for a reason. I might have donated in an organisation but in most cases lion share of my donation would have been spent against overhead costs (salaries/office expenses etc) instead of the truly deserving candidate themselves. I could have paid Zakat to finance a person who wants to start a business but in this world chances of being duped is higher with education expense the loss would be lower than trying to finance a business. And if I help 10 persons and able to reach 1 truly deserving one I would have been successful in my intention. Also doing this with the hope that may be in the end when you get established you would do the same for someone else in need.",
