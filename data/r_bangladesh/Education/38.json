  "description": "Hello everyone,\nI graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from a private university. I am now exploring my next steps, and I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in Data Analytics or Data Science. However, I am somewhat concerned about the job market in Bangladesh and would appreciate any advice from those who are already working in the field or have insight into the local situation.",

Look at some job posts for junior positions and you will understand what kind of skills you require to land a job. You can seek a mentor who is a senior professional in any of those sectors.\nAn MSc only makes sense for a career in Data Science. For that you better try at a foreign university.",
