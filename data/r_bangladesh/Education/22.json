  "description": "I am an English-medium student, and I don’t understand how to fill in the “subject total” section. Also, I passed my O Levels in 2020, and due to COVID-19, all my grades were predicted grades. I received good grades, but my raw marks are shown as 000 on the certificate. Will my grades be accepted or not? I tried calling the helpline, but they were very rude and not helpful at all.",
