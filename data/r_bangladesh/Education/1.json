  "description": "I know that NSU offers waivers to students who maintain a good CGPA as undergraduates. My question is: for a master’s degree, can I receive a 100% waiver if I’m admitted to NSU or BRAC for a CSE‑related program? What are the criteria? I’m planning to pursue a master’s and am currently comparing both universities.\nP.S. I completed my BSc in CSE from another private university in Bangladesh.",
