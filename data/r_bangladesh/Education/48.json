  "description": "Hi everyone,\nI've recently completed my HSC exams(2025) and now I'm trying to pursue my bachelors degree from Germany. So,Bangladeshi students actually cannot directly study in Germany right after HSC.They need to complete at least 2 semesters in a Bangladeshi universityand then apply for the German universities.\nSo,I want to complete my 2 semesters in a private Bangladeshi university(eg:Brac).Now I want to know:\n1.If I apply for the spring 26 intake in brac university will I be able to complete my 2 semester within March/April 2027 ?\n2.Is there any universitiy in Bangladesh from where I can transfer credits to the German Universities?\n3..I know that there is a 2 year waiting period for visa of Germany. To cut that,I want to take a German Visa Appoinment right now(November 2025).Is there any chance that I will get called before October 2027?Is this a right decision to do so?\n4.Just imagine by chance I get called a lot earlier than I've thought, for example,in a time while I'm still applying to German universities or do not have an offer letter. In that case what may I do.Will it take that much longer time(20-24 months) if I reschedule my visa appoinment?\nPlease help me by answering these questions.I'm quite new to this journey. So please pardon any of my silly mistakes/assumptions.It will be great if anyone can help me in this journey",
