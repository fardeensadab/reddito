  "description": "Hey I’m in my 2nd year of college (humanities) and trying to figure out what major to focus on. Ik it might feel a lil early but I want to start preparing for university admissions especially since people around me (parents, teachers) said I should’ve started way back in 1st year. Better late than never ig? rn I’m considering three options: economics, international relations and law Out of these, IR really fascinates me. But the problem is I’m super shy and introverted. We technically have a debate club at my college but it’s not very active so I haven’t really had a space to build those skills. My teacher actually discouraged me from pursuing IR or Law saying I might not be able to handle it bc of my personality. So now I’m confused. Is IR even doable for someone like me? Do introverts survive or even thrive in that field? What does the future look like for IR students especially in a place like Bangladesh? Also I’ve been eyeing BUP for a while now. Any tips on how to start preparing seriously for that?\nWould love to hear from people who’ve been through something similar or know what IR/Law/Econ are like in real life. Any insight would be awesome. Thanks in advance!!",

Just small interactions will be first step for you gaining confidence. Being introverted will only make you cry bcz this world/ country is not for introverts. But I'll prefer IR too. Since you'll learn about a lot of deep information which will be helpful in making judgement in upcoming days. It'll help you imao🫡",
