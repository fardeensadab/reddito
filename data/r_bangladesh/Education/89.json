  "description": "I've finished 81 credits in CSE from BracU in CSE. Right now, my cgpa is 2.2 (Last year was terrible in terms of my university grades). So, it looks like I can no longer continue in BracU, therefore suggest me some Universities with relaxed credit transfer system I can move to.\nAt this point I am quite desperate, looking for the fastest way to complete graduation. Thanks.",
