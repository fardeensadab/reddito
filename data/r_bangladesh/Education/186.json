  "description": "my dad was really furious at my cousin in the village for getting an A instead of an A+ on his SSC. Apparently it will hurt his chances at medical or engineering school later on. Aren't there perfectly other careers that someone could do besides those things?\nWhat do most people get on the SSC?\nDoes this have to do with the apparent lack of white collar jobs in Bangladesh?\nI'm an American so very clueless here.\nedit: sorry I meant the SSC, not the SSE!!",
