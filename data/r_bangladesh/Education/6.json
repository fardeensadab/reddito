  "title": "Got Biochemistry & Biotechnology at NSU- confused about job prospects in Bangladesh. Need advice!",
  "description": "Hey everyone,\nI just got into Biochemistry and Biotechnology at NSU, and I’ve heard from quite a few people that the job opportunities for this field in Bangladesh are pretty limited, and that most graduates usually aim for higher studies abroad.\nI do want to study abroad in the future, but a full scholarship isn’t guaranteed, and my family can’t afford international tuition on their own. Because of that, I’m feeling a bit unsure about choosing this major.\nSo I wanted to ask:\nIs it true that the job market for Biochem/Biotech in Bangladesh is very narrow?\nCould choosing this subject affect my long-term career if I end up staying here?\nAnyone studying or working in this field what’s your experience like?\nAny advice or insight would really help. Thanks in advance! ❤️",

      "text": "I am not in this sector, but from my experience, it is difficult to get jobs in these fields. You will need to move abroad for higher studies and perhaps plan for a PhD, as you mentioned your family can't afford such high costs. A PhD is often free in most countries. For a PhD, try to maintain a good CGPA (3.8+ would be ideal) and publish some research papers.",
