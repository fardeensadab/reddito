  "description": "I've passed my SSC(2023) and HSC(2025) from BMARPC and my SSC result was gpa-4.50. As far as I can tell about my HSC result, it will be higher than gpa-4.50 but I'm not confident enough to say I will get gpa-5.00. That's all I have as my educational certificates.\nFor my future plans, things did not go smoothly. My mother threw me into unmesh and my dad made me start an IELTS program in Luminedge. I'm struggling but things are going somewhat properly without me breaking apart.\nOne thing I am confident about is that I can communicate with people without struggling too much. For that reason my parents feel a bit relieved about sending me abroad. So, living alone in an entirely new country with everything being different than where I grew up, would be hard but not impossible.\nWhen I talked with the people in Luminedge about my intentions on going abroad they reassured me that I can apply to European countries such as Sweden, Ireland, Finland, UK and France. But I lack the proper info. On the internet, no info gives me an accurate answer that I can properly trust. Some say I need 13 years of education, some say I can apply with my 12 years of education and a good IELTS score. If I need to, I will prepare myself for AP examination or SAT.\nNow my question:\nAre there any universities for undergraduate students like me in Europe? If yes, then what countries offer scholarships?",
