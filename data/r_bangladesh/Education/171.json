  "title": "Can I Study Abroad After a Long Gap? Need Advice",
  "description": "Hello everyone,\nI need some advice and hope someone can help me.\nI finished my HSC in 2019 from the Business Studies group. After that, I joined a college, but I had to stop because of personal reasons. Since then, I have had a long gap in my formal education.\nDuring this time, I found that I really enjoy computer programming. I learned many things by myself especially in web development. Because of that, in December 2024, I started studying again and this time in a diploma program in Computer Science and Technology.\nNow, my goal is to study undergraduate level abroad. My first choice is Computer Science, because I love it and want to work in this field. But I know it may be difficult because I studied business before and have a long gap. If studying Computer Science is not possible, I'm also ready to choose Business Studies again. My most important goal is to study abroad and make a better future for myself.\nHere are my questions:\nIs it possible to change from Business Studies to Computer Science abroad?\nWill the long study gap cause problems?\nWhat can I do to make my application stronger?",
