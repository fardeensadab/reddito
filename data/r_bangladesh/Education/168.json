  "description": "On behalf of a friend:\nhello everyone, I'm thinking about doing a 2nd bachelor's at BracU in Microbiology. My 1st bachelor's was in a non-STEM subject and I could never connect with that. Even after graduation I feel like I've learned nothing and that it was the biggest mistake of my life. I don't know how else to fix it other than by stepping back and starting from scratch again because my ultimate goal is to become a researcher in the genetic engineering field.\nI was wondering if this will be a wise decision for me, especially since I'm from a middle class family with financial restrictions. Please give me your honest advice.",
