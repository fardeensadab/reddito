  "description": "Hello.. I'm currently doing MBBS in a government medical college. I'm in 4th year now .I want to seat for USMLE. Though haven't taken any initiative till now. I wanna start from next year. Actually I'm confused about the whole process. Besides I don't know anyone here who have already taken usmle or wants to seat for it. I would highly appreciate if anyone wanna discuss and study together from the beginning.",
