  "title": "Need reassurance and advice for SSC (2026 batch)",
  "description": "I'm in 10th grade, will give my ssc next year (2026). I'm really tensed and nervous as I don't have much time. I have started studying properly in April, after I kept a tutor. I am studying 3 to 4 hours a day, which I know isn't enough and I'm keeping a goal for 6 to 8 from onwards. I am stuck in physics as it took me 2 months to finish ch 02 (motion) and also ch 02 of Higher maths. My goal is to get a GPA 5. I also have a routine which I have been following, for a month or so now. I'm most tensed about physics, higher math and general math, and to many people's shock also B1 and B2 as I'm in English version and I've lived in middle eastern country where I didn't study bangla much. Being overwhelmed, I am feeling pretty lost and hopeless. Need advice.",
