  "description": "Hi! I've been thinking about moving to Germany for higher studies after A-Levels.\nCurrently I'm in AS (first year of A-Levels) and just sat for Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Economics in the may june session. I was wondering whether it's worth it to give German 9717 exams in Oct-Nov session. Does Germany formally accept this course for language proficiency? Will it be worth it to sit for this paper? Or do I have better options in Bangladesh? (i.e courses/tests that are more prioritized in Germany than this one)",
