  "description": "Hello BD community!\nWelcome to another help seeking post. my first one indeed:\")\nSo am a candidate from HSC-24, didn't get into any uni. I always wanted to study abroad and now thinking to apply for chinese universities. Family won't provide for me after getting into college, so I need a full tuition with stipend covering the monthly fees. Now how should I start selecting unis in china and what do i need to get a full free scholarship in china? I've just learned about entrance exams for these unis. How do I prepare for them? I know that IELTS wont convince them for a scholarship and they don't want SAT. should I still go for SAT? or what else?\nI would also like to know about EU countries with minimal budget or scholarships that are easy to get.\nThanks in advance",
