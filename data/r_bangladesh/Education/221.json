  "description": "Is it possible to pursue a masters degree in chemical engineering after completing a bachelor's degree in chemistry from National university?\nIm currently doing honours I'm chemistry from national university and I intend to pursue chemical engineering in masters. But is that possible? How should I do it? Do I need to do additional courses? Where can I study chemical engineering in Bangladesh? How much could it cost? Can I apply for masters in a public university after studying in National university? If so, how should I do it? Or do I have to do my masters in a private university? Is it better to go abroad? Which one is more cost affective? I'm currently feeling very lost and would appreciate friendly advice.",
