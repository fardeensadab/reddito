I had Laptop which was fkin slow but I was using it for learning web development and Allah knows how I came this far with this .But yesterday out of no where my laptop got shut down and its not turning . So I am thinking to buy a new one . But I don't have enough money for that. (don't ask me why not taking money from family ... I had enough this shit)\nI am young ,ready to learn and first learner I can say . It wouldn't take more than one day to adjust any work environment for me.\nNow I need a job to buy new one . Any one looking for teacher like English , Bangla or Biology . Then please knock me . Also anyone hiring in super shop or restaurant waiter please let me know.\nThanks",
