  "description": "I’m an HSC ’26 student, and I’ve got a real passion for Biotechnology and Biochemistry — mainly Biotech. I know the job market for these fields in Bangladesh isn’t great, but my long-term goal is to go abroad for a PhD and work in research.\nPrivate universities aren’t an option for me, so I’m aiming for public ones. My top choices right now are DU, RU, BAU, and JU.\nIf any of you are studying Biotech or Biochem, I’d love to hear your thoughts — what should I expect, how should I prepare, and what’s your overall experience been like?",
