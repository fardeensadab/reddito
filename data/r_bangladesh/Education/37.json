  "description": "I'm going to take the admission exam this time and it's my second attempt. I was preparing for CU Unit C but the BUP FBS subjects seem pretty similar, except for Analytical Skill and GK. Since I'm preparing for CU Unit C, if I just focus on improving my GK, will my previous preparation help me in the BUP FBS exam? I might be lacking some information. I would also appreciate some valuable advice for my admission journey, please.",
