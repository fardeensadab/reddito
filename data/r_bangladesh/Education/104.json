  "description": "Assalamualikum everyone,\nI(20F) am currently in urgent need of a reliable laptop for my studies and academic work(undergrad in Biotechnology). I can’t afford a new one. If anyone is selling, I would be extremely grateful. Here are the specifications I’m looking for:\nEven a used laptop matching these specs would be a huge help. I really appreciate any leads, advice, or offers.\nThank you so much in advance!",
