  "description": "Hello everyone! Assalamu Alaikum. I am a first year fresher, doing my BSc (Eng) in the dept of Building Engineering & Construction Management (BECM) at XUET. I have been thinking about my career options and I realize there are several paths I can explore once I graduate. Note that before I go for a job, I want to complete my Master's in a relevant field to my career choice. Maybe I will try for the United States but that's still not something I am sure about. There are various options open for me to explore once I graduate like - Structural Engineering, Construction engineering, construction management, BIM modeling etc. I would love to hear your insights regarding these career paths, their industry demand and the relevant skills that I should learn to be ahead in the race. Also is there something, relevant to my field of study that I can do while as a student to earn some pocket money? I want to develop my skills and want to stay ahead in the race. Many of my friends are majoring in Computer Sciene and Software engineering and they are already making nice money you know and I get jealous sometimes ngl. So I was wondering if I could do something similar that would also be relevant to my field of study. Thanks in advance for your valuable advice.",
