  "description": "I’ll be starting my Bachelor of Engineering in Australia in February 2026. My plan is to try for PR in Australia, but if that doesn’t work out, I’ll return to my country for a year or two and then pursue a Master’s in Canada, the USA, or another country—probably in a field like renewable energy or robotics, where PR chances are better.\nHere’s my main question: Out of Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Mechatronics, or Software Engineering, which branch would allow me to get a good job in Bangladesh around 2030 (in 5–6 years)?\nIt doesn’t have to be a strictly engineering job.\nI’d be open to working in finance, corporate roles, or related industries, as long as the pay is medium to high.\nI’ll also have work experience from Australia (on a temporary graduate visa) before returning, so that could give me an edge.\nWhat do you think would be the best option for me, both for flexibility and future-proofing my career in Bangladesh?",
