  "description": "Hi! I’m an HSC 2027 student. My goal is engineering admission, mainly aiming to crack BUET. I’m not sure if I can make it happen, but I’ll give it my best .\nI also attend some offline private classes for a few subjects, but my main plan is to study online. I think it’ll be hard to stay focused throughout the year alone.\nSo, I’m thinking of creating a small group of 3–5 people—too many members can get messy.\nWe can help each other with information, problem-solving, tips, discussions about which class or question bank is better, etc.\nIt’s not like we’ll be studying live together, but we’ll set daily targets and share our progress at the end of the day—for example, solving 1000 MCQs or finishing one chapter of math. We can also attend online exams together, or discuss other ideas later.\nNo unnecessary or random chatting. After a week or a month, we’ll review how much we’ve improved, and if it’s worth it, we’ll continue.\nI’m not sure if it will work, but let’s give it a try.\nThe group isn’t created yet; we’ll figure out together the best platform—Discord or something else.",
