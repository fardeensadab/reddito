  "description": "Hello! I co-founded Ryogen with the idea to help students move abroad using AI and as an international student myself living in Japan, I thought I could help students like myself to move abroad without the hassle of consultancy agencies. Now, any student who's currently in grade 10-12 are encouraged to apply to this program since this can be a great opportunity for your ECA towards abroad and most importantly the experience and skills you will gain from an AI Startup.\nAs a Bangladeshi, I would love to connect with such individuals who wish to help others and themselves moving to their dream university or country. Cheers!",
