  "description": "We recently had pre-test exams and i am sure i did well in maths but sir told me today i failed for 6 marks which is ripping my heart apart out of anger and regret. I am damn sure that I wrote more than pass marks and i will pass but sir also later said that there's a chance that my copy was wrongly checked and they might have made me fail mistakenly. I will get to see my copy next week. But if i actually failed, what will i answer my mom and my sister? I am confident that i passed in all other 11 subjects In Sha Allah except maths.....",
