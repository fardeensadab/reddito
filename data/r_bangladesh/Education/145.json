  "description": "I'm planning to apply for the Spring 2026 intake for a B.Sc. in Architecture program at BRAC University, and I was wondering if anyone could clarify something for me.\nWhen exactly does the first semester end for Spring intakes? Does it usually wrap up by the end of May, or does it continue into early June? If it's in June, does anyone know the approximate date when the semester typically finishes?\nAny help from current students would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
