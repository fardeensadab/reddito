  "description": "For the past few months I've been quiet overwhelmed by the fact on how to study efficiently for O levels. For the most part I've been studying alone, with 2 tutors helping me with maths and science subjects (Physics Chemistry). I have gotten quiet mid marks in Bangla during my last finals, and I want to improve it. Though I don't necessarily know where to start from, where to get the materials and so. Same goes for English as well. If you have any tips, anything that can open my mind, you can write down here or DM personally. Will help a lot :))",
