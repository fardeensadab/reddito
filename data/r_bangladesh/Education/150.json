  "description": "Hello Good People!\nI'm a PhD student in the US and I want to interview some people online for my research. My research is about the use of Dating Apps. So, if you have experience of using any kind of Dating Apps (Tinder, Bumble, Muzz, Grindr, HeeSay etc.), it would be a big help for my research.\nEverything will be anonymous so your privacy will not be hampered at all and the data will only be used for research work. If you are interested, please feel free to DM me or comment here, and we can take this further. This can also be a good chance for you to rant and vent out haha.\nThanks in Advance!",
