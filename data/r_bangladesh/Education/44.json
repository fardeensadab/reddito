  "description": "I've been hearing from others to choose AIUB EEE over BracU EEE. Can anyone who studies in BracU tell me about the quality of EEE in BracU. As in how qualitative their lab facilities, lectures, research is and etc. Because BracU is very close to my home and AIUB is a bit far away from my home actually.",
