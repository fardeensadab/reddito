  "description": "So I have 4 subjects( phy, chem,math and bio), my parents aren't allowing me to give exams in two sessions and I also don't wanna sit for retakes, due to this I want to drop physics as it's the subject I'm the weakest in.\nNow, the thing is dropping physics basically turns off engineering and medical in bd, which I'm not really that bumped about, but I'm worried it might also prevent me from pursuing other fields like pharmacy, biochem, etc. So what degrees can I still pursue wo physics in bd?",

I don't know if Bangladesh is in the stone age still or they are as flexible.",
