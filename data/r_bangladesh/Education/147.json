  "description": "I am planning to study in China. Not necessarily this year, maybe next year or so. I am trying to do everything on my own. But it feels overwhelming to do everything alone or without any guidance. It would have been nice if I had a partner who also wants to study in China. I think I will feel comfortable and at ease if I could complete the process with a study partner.\nAnyone interested feel free to DM. Note: Please, no agency promotion.",
