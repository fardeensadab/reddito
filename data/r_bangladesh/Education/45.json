  "description": "Hi everyone. I'm a student from Bangladesh, I'll be starting my undergrad soon and I want to major in Physics. My plan is to get admitted to the Physics department of the University of Dhaka (where I live) and do my undergrad there. For postgrad, I want to do my master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics at a top university abroad. I want to build my career in research and/or teaching theoretical physics.\nSince there is basically zero opportunity for physics graduates in my country, I plan to move abroad for my career. To go through with my plan, I would need a fully funded scholarship for my Master's and PhD, as it's impossible for me to pay for education abroad. Unfortunately I don't have much idea about scholarships. If anyone can help me with what scholarships I could apply for and what opportunities they could be for me, that would be greatly appreciated. I'll also have 4 years ahead of me before my Master's, so I think that's enough time to prepare myself. So basically I need help with the idea of a roadmap. Suggestions on scholarship programmes I could apply for is also appreciated. I'm very dedicated to this goal, so I'd be very grateful to anyone who helps out, thanks 🙏",
