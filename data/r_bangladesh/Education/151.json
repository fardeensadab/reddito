  "description": "Im from HSC 24, so not willing to wait any longer for BUP and stuff. Could get admitted last semester for personal reasons. This semester I'm giving exams for all three of these.\nWhich one would be the best? For both job prospects, education but also like actually studying there and having a social life. I dont wanna try hard for four years. I'd say I'm a decent student. Almost got into DU IBA, failed because of my poor communications skills and some bad luck, and there still is a very very slim chance I might get into JU IBA (exams were on feb but the admission stuff still hasnt finished somehow).\nIf any current student of any would give input on how it is for both studying, getting and maintaining waivers and stuff I'd be grateful.",
