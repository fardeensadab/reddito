  "description": "I’m curious if there are any private universities or research groups in Bangladesh that actively work or teach in the field of spatial economics, economic geography, or related areas using GIS and spatial data analysis.\nAre there any graduate programs (like master’s or MPhil) in private universities that include GIS, remote sensing, or spatial analysis in their curriculum? Any leads or experiences would be really helpful!",
