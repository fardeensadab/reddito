  "description": "Hsc-24 didn’t study at all during college days that's why never sit for any public exam thought I would eventually get into private uni but now my family is pressuring me for 2nd time as they can't afford the fees. Also I got the reality check and realized but It's too late now still having 1% hope.\nIs there any way to take precise preparation for BUP FST? I have completely forgot everything from HSC but I think I wanna give a last try. Please help seniors or batch mates.",
