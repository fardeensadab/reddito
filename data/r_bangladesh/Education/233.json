It is a bit silly but I guess employees see many people with these qualifications and from their point of view does make sure they are older (greater maturity and responsibility) and more educated (lower training costs).\nUltimately these things are driven by supply and demand. If they do not find enough MBAs willing to do this work they will remove the requirement.",
