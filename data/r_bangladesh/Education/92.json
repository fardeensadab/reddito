  "description": "Hi everyone,\nI’m starting early preparation for the CERN Summer Student Program 2026 and wanted to ask if anyone here has experience with the application or knows what can give an edge. Im currently studying CSE at North South University(8th semester)\nSome things I’m curious about:\nWhat kind of skills or projects stand out (programming, research, etc.)?\nHow important are GPA, recommendation letters, or prior research work?(cgpa 2.9 )\nTips for writing a strong motivation letter or CV.\nCommon mistakes applicants make.\nOn a personal note, this internship means a lot to me. As far as I know, no one from Bangladesh has been selected before (I couldnt find yet) so I’d love to try and represent us there. Sometimes I feel nervous or afraid, but I’m trying to stay courageous and prepare step by step.\nIf anyone else here is also planning to apply, maybe we can share resources and coach each other. Would love to hear from you all.\nThanks a lot in advance for any guidance or encouragement!",

Enough hard work can make you indistinguishable from them though. keep trying, good luck.",
