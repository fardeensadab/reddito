  "description": "Looking to get reviews on Haileybury Bhaluka. Is anyone in this sub familiar with the school? Specifically anything you can share around teachers, curriculum, how it differs from the rest (Sunbeams, Sunnydale, etc), what's the environment like, and student body? Is the quality of education better or is it just a glorified boarding school with not much difference? Thanks",
