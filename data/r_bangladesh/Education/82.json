  "description": "I'm now done with college, but I posted something similar on 7th October 2023 just a day before college orientation. I made the mistake of posting it on a general subreddit dominated by Americans. They gave advice that would have been applicable for a United States based University student. But I was asking about Bangladeshi National Curriculum based 11th and 12th Grade students.",
