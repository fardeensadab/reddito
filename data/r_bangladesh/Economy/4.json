  "description": "Hi everyone!\nI’ve been working on a small hobby project for the last four months- an anonymous, location-based chat app built fully in Replit. You can chat with people within ~50 km, or even change your location (like Tinder Passport) to a few selected cities. If you don’t want to share your location then you can chat with others who also disallowed locations.\nFeel free to try it out — feedback of any kind is really appreciated!\nLink: https://coffeeshop.chat/\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",
