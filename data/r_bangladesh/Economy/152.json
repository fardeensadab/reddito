  "title": "When Someone With Zero Economic Knowledge Tries to Explain Inflation...",
  "description": "So, today I had a conversation with a guy from a certain political group who casually dropped this gem: \"The current government is useless. Inflation is way too high.\"\nNaturally, I said, \"Hold up, what makes you think it's useless? Inflation has actually gone down.\"\nThis guy—who, I swear, probably just Googled the word inflation yesterday—confidently replies, \"Of course it's useless! Inflation should be negative so prices go down and the economy keeps running.\"\nI was left speechless. Just stared at him, trying to figure out if I was being pranked. He then follows up with, \"If they can't make it negative, at least bring it to zero.\"\nAt this point, I couldn't even. I just said, \"Yeah, bro, definitely useless.\"\nHonestly, I think we need to start teaching economics in kindergarten. Step by step, so future generations don't think deflation = economic success. Because... yikes.",
