  "title": "Why Are Card Payments Still Discouraged at BCS Computer City?",
  "description": "I recently bought something from BCS Computer City and noticed that almost every shop discouraged card payments. In fact, I had to pay an extra 3% just to use my card.\nIf the NPSB (National Payment Switch Bangladesh) only charges 10–15 BDT per transaction, why doesn’t Bangladesh Bank integrate that system with POS machines directly? That way, instead of shops passing on a 3% surcharge, customers could just pay a flat fee—like 10 BDT—which is far more reasonable.\nIndia, for example, has zero transaction fee.",
