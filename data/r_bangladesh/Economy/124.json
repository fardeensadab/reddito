      "text": "I don't know about others .But I observe the recent plunge of the DSEX to a near five-year low of 4,781 with cautious concern . This isn’t merely a correction , DSEX is reflecting a profound crisis in investor confidence driven by herding behavior, loss aversion, which exacerbated by external shocks like the India-Pakistan tensions and the central bank’s shift to market-based exchange rates to secure IMF loans. These factors catalyzed fear of currency devaluation, and have fueled panic selling thus amplified market sentiment If you observe closely you can see that, daily turnover has dropped 33% which signals liquidity concerns, reminiscent of a liquidity trap where investors hoard cash, stifling market activity amid uncertainty. The chief adviser’s inconclusive 11 May 2025 meeting on the crisis failed to restore momentum, while the looming budget declaration without retail investor incentives exacerbate volatility.\nFundamentally, a deeper issue persists: an entrenched belief—shared by many policymakers and even many economists that Bangladesh’s stock market is more like a speculative casino which undermines its role as a core economic pillar. Approximately a large proportion of retail investors are short-term traders, chasing quick profits in junk or Z-category shares rather than investing in undervalued, financially robust blue chip stocks for long term. This irrational exuberance inflates bubbles, which inevitably burst, wiping out portfolios of retail investors.\nTo address this problems, first and foremost regulatory reform is necessary. Utilizing a stabilization fund, enforcing stricter margin loan regulations, introducing targeted tax incentives, implementing T+0 settlements, and launching a pre-trade session like the post-trade one—could collectively stabilize the DSEX which will promote long-term investing and reinforce its economic significance.",
