  "title": "Energy adviser blames section of politicians, businessmen for crisis in gas sector",
  "description": "\"The crisis in the gas sector did not happen overnight or by itself. A group of politicians and their business associates have brought us to today's situation,\" he said.\nHe made the remarks while speaking at a discussion titled 'LPG in Bangladesh: Economy, Environment and Safety' held at the Hotel Sonargaon in Dhaka.\nFouzul Kabir said unnecessary capacity was built in power generation without considering the required gas supply to support it.\n\"In the private sector, many industries were promised gas connections. Even knowing there was no gas, lines were given, unjustly, through corruption. As a result, we are now facing this crisis,\" he added.\nHe pointed out the difference between gas and electricity, saying, \"In electricity, you can shut off supply in one area and redirect it elsewhere. But that cannot be done with gas. It's first come, first served, whoever comes first, gets it.\"",
