  "description": "Which phone should I buy under 25,000 BDT in Bangladesh? Need advice from users of Samsung, Realme, Redmi, etc.\nPost:\nHi everyone,\nI’m looking to buy a new Android phone in Bangladesh, and my budget is around 20,000–25,000 BDT. I’d really appreciate help from anyone who has personally used phones in this range.\nGood battery life (lasts all day)\nFast and smooth performance (no lag during regular use)\nReliable brand and build quality (something that lasts 6–7 years)\nGood camera\n128 GB or more storage, or at least expandable storage\nEnough RAM to run multiple apps (I use many apps daily)\nNot a gamer, but I like trying new AI tools and apps (which sometimes need more RAM and storage)",
