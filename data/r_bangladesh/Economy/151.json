Look up Jamuna TV's covering of the situation and compare with that of people who've participated in the worker's protests. They even tried to manufacture a sob story about how an owner had to sell their car even though paying the workers actually costs less than 15% of their annual revenue. Independent even straight up lied and reported that everyone in Gazipur got paid.",
