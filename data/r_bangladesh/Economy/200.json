          "text": "Agreed. We imported 17.41% of our total consumption of electricity from India, most of which came from Adani, even though we had the capacity to produce all of it using our own coal-based power plants.\nWe do not need to build any more power plants at the moment because our installed capacity stands at about 28,000 MW which is a lot higher our current needs. However, I believe we will definitely build more nuclear at some point in the future when our politicians realize that solar and wind can't do everything, gas reserves are dwindling, and coal is just too dirty.",
