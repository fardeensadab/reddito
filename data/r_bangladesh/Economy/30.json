      "text": "Actually in domestic market of Bangladesh ,there is a lack of effective competition and business often create syndicate and that's why even though in global market prices might fall, local market prices don't fall because of them as they are reluctant to reduce the market prices by providing justification like high transport costs , high priced stock etc. Also in Bangladesh , supply chain of food and non food products in is extremely complex , For this reason, even though import prices have decreased due to Taka's devaluation, intermediary costs associated with imports have not decreased yet. Also there are supply side bottlenecks as well. Moreover , Inflation expectations in Bangladesh are still high.\nI think a simple Economic Model can help to understand the scenario very easily:\nP=(1+τ)×(E ×Pm *)+S\nHere,\nP= Local Market Price\nPm *= Global Market Price\nE = Exchange Rate ( USD Per BDT )\nτ = All types of duties, tariffs on import\nS = Local supply side costs\nHere if Pm *(Global Market Price) decreases , P( Local Market Price) will decrease if and only if E. τ, S remains constant. In the case of BD, non price factors offsetting the global price decline",
