It should be possible now that BPDB is no longer a monopoly.",

          "text": "Did you read the article? The buyers are pressuring RMG companies to at least use/buy 20 percent of electricity produced from renewables, not fossil fuels. To address this, the RMG companies can directly enter into PPAs with solar power plants and avoid the BPDB from now because of MPP model. Robi is taking advantage of this model and has now decided to build a 100 MWp solar power plant for its own use. The BPDB will not be involved in this project in any way.\nThe Energy Advisor definitely screwed up by cancelling the Letter of Intents for renewable energy projects planned by Hasina. That's one of the reasons the BPDB received no bid for planned solar power plants.",
