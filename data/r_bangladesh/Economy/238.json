  "description": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/363482/khulna-non-profit-stores-see-unexpected-profit\nHriday Ghorami, a member of the Khulna Anti-Discrimination Student Movement market control task force, told Dhaka Tribune: \"We purchase goods at wholesale rates and sell them at the same prices through the non-profit shops. Minor differences in weight cause prices to sometimes round up (eg, Tk25.25 becomes Tk26), resulting in a marginal profit. Through these five points, we earned Tk1,500 in profit over two days, with an average profit of Tk150 from each point per day.\"\n\"The profits from this project will be invested in a rooftop gardening initiative, starting November 1 in Khulna. Our goal is to convert every rooftop in Khulna city and district into gardens. To this end, 40 members of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have already received training. They will work to transform each roof into a green space,” he added.\nHriday said the price of green chillies was Tk400 taka per kg at Boyra Market on Sunday, but “once we introduced the non-profit shop, the price dropped to Tk200 taka, while we sold it at Tk150 taka.”",
