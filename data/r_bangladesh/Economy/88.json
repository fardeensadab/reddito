  "description": "Government has a vision of exporting 1 billion dollar worth of semi conductor and ic. For this they already had taken initiatives domestically . Now the government is looking to foreign partners and it appears they have already started doing it. This is MOU contains partnership for skill development and integrated circuit related technology . To those that think it's impossible, producing ic at the least isn't any rocket science. It's not that complicated but it still falls under knowledge based industry, something we lack very much. Though the future is dim mainly because of the elections next year which will dictate the programmes future ( consider it never happening if bnp is forming government)",
