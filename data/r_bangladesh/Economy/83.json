  "description": "I think I know a MLM business, named otithee.com , went to their program, they are literally scamming innocent people, they are telling people that they earn a very good amount from their rental business and later they share it to their Investors but all I can see is a shady website. There's also a news about them on ekattor TV, when I asked one of the person who invited me to their program, he replied that it's because of some extortion issue. You guy's can check the video from ekattor TV YouTube channel. This thing should stop before being another destiny.",
