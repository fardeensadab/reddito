  "description": "I know that you can't just send money from Bangladesh unless it's for specific reasons like student/medical or just business related stuff.\nWhat I am wondering is can there be a problem if I try transferring all my money from Payoneer account since it is what I used to pay taxes and send some money to my BD bank account.\nI know that from common knowledge just because it has my BD bank account info and I paid taxes doesn't mean it follows BD laws but with things like this I don't want to take chances. So here I am.\nThanks in advance.",
