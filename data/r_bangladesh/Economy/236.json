Ideally we should focus on something that’s more exclusive to us (like moslin), or other sectors that’s more suitable for us (fresh water fish or local fruits).\nWe can, in theory, pour money into ship building industries and build our own infrastructure for a cheaper alternative. This used to be my dream when I first learned about our ship dismantling industry. (But it’s a very far fetched idea)",
