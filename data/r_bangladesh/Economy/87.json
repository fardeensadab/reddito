  "title": "Why do you think our foreign reserves are not growing in line with the economy's scale? What are the key factors preventing us from achieving a more robust and ideal reserve position, and what steps could be taken to bridge this significant gap?",
  "description": "Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves are currently hovering around $31 billion. While this number might seem substantial, when you compare it to the size of our economy (the world's 34th largest, nominal GDP), some economists argue that an ideal reserve should be closer to $80 billion to ensure stability.",

Last year, our import payment was $64.35 billion while our exports amounted to $43.96 billion.\nOur trade deficit with China is $16 billion. In essence, when China offers loans to Bangladesh, they are lending our own money back to us.",
