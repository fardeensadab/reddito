  "description": "I have a few thousand dollars (USD) in my Payoneer account and don't really use any BD banks other then for the one that I made for the Payoneer account. I just use that for taxes.\nI'm moving to the US (not a student)so was just wondering if I could just transfer that money to a US bank account that I'm going to open.\nMy main goal is to basically transfer like $20k from my Payoneer Account to the US account that I'm gonna have.",
