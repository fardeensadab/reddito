  "description": "\"Officials said the government is now looking at ways to reduce power production costs as a means to limit subsidy requirements. The initial plan aims to bring down production costs by around 10 percent, which would potentially save Tk 10,000–11,000 crore.\nZahid Hussain said that small steps have already been taken. These include lowering the service charge for furnace oil-based power plants from 9 percent to 5 percent. He also pointed to the need for a cost review of power producers and mentioned that the coal for Payra power plant is currently overpriced.\nHe added that starting operations at gas-based power plants like the one in Khulna's Rupsha would also help reduce dependency on more expensive fuels.\n\"But the government needs to act fast,\" he said, noting that the price of the dollar has a direct impact on production costs as it affects dollar-denominated capacity payments.\"",
