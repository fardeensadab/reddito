      "text": "Due to pressure from the IMF, if the BD government is moving towards a flexible rate, it may lead to a depreciation of the taka and an appreciation of the dollar rate. As flexible exchange rate depends on market forces, it can help increase export competitiveness. However, there is a risk of increased inflation. But I think , this risk can be easily mitigated by prudent policies. However leaping from BDT 120 to 150 is improbable.",
